### Styling

This project utilizes Spectre.Console.

It is an open-source .NET library that makes it easier to create beautiful console applications.

### Class Structure

Classes are arranged in two separate folders:

* "Classes" folder contains classes used for communicating with the PostgreSQL database.

* "UI" folder contains classes used for the application interface.

### Database

The "Data" folder contains a class that connects to the PostgreSQL database with the help of Dapper.

The connection string is then used throughout our source code for sending and reveiving SQL queries.

We managed our database through DbGate.
